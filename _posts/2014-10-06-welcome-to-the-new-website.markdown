Welcome to the new Yellow Feather website! We've been busy updating the website to make it reflect our current activities and also make it easier to update. It is still a work in progress, if you notice any issues please let us know!

For the technically minded, the site is a static website, built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) all for free! The source is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yellowfeather/yellowfeather.github.com).

The site also makes use of the excellent Sass libraries from [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com):

- Bourbon: http://bourbon.io
- Neat: http://neat.bourbon.io
- Bitters: http://bitters.bourbon.io
- Refills: http://refills.bourbon.io

This is the first time that I've used these and I'm really impressed, they make generating clean, semantic HTML a breeze.

    <p>
      Many ERP / MRP system struggle to handle the complexities of the
      aerospace supply chain, such as: part aliases & alternatives, kitting,
      import and analysis of MRP data and you end up using spreadsheets and /
      or Access databases to work around these, and other shortcomings. Also,
      it can often be difficult to get the data out of the system to get the
      reports you need and when you want them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're experiencing any of these issues, then I can help you!

        <h4>Planning & forecasting</h4>
        <p>
          Import customer MRP forecasts and project a rolling stock position over the next 12, 24 or 36 months, taking
          into account current stock positions, supplier lead times, sales and purchase orders. Parts that have
          insufficient stock to meet demand are highlighted so that they can be actioned and prevent a stock out.
